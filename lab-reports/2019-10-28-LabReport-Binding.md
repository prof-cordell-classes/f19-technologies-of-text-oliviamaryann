# Lab Report: Binding 

#### Olivia Mastrosimone 

##Process Description 
In this lab, we bound our Twitter bot poems that we had printed in our previous labs into a small folio. When we walked into the room, there were stations set up at each seat. We were given the two pages of poetry, a yellow cover page, a bone folder, an awl, and a pencil. We started by folding our three sheets – a step that would seemingly be the easiest but required much more attention and care than I expected. We lined up our fold and took the bone folder to create a perfect, clean fold right in the middle of the page. After we did that three times, we measured out where the holes would be in the inner fold of our book. We made five equally spaced marks down the center fold, placed the books on the cradle and poked holes through the marks with out awls. This step was harder than I expected too, as it required much more force than I thought to get the awl through all three sheets of heavy paper. 

After we marked and punched the holes in our books, we had to actually bind the pages together with thread. We were given thick, waxy thread and a needle. We measured out two and a half book lengths of thread, and Professor Cordell explained the sewing method we were to use when binding. It was a bit complicated, and to be completely honest I dont remember the exact order of which holes we sewed through when, but I slowly sewed the book together and that was it! I had a book that I printed and bound sitting in front of me. 

## Observations 
This lab was a bit less labor intensive than I had anticipated. I expected the process to be much more involved than it was. This isn't to say I didn't find this lab interesting and valuable, I was just shocked by how straighfoward it was. I know we were using a very simple binding technique, but at every step I was thinking "it's really *this* easy?" Going into the lab, I was worried I would struggle with completing the task, but I found it to be relatively simple, and really enjoyable. 

I am aware, though, that most 18th and 19th century book binders were not working with three sheets of cardstock and a sewing needle. So, after I initially processed my relief at the exercise's ease, I became overwhelmed thinking about how *actual* book binders bound *actual* books – 100, 200 page novels with thick, leather covers. I genuinely couldn't comprehend how this was done by hand or by machine, which prompted me to go on an hour long Google binge about historical book binding. Needless to say, this lab taught me a lot, and inspired me to do independent research about binding techniques! 

## Analysis 
Throughout the semester, we've been asked to think about what a book is outside of it's text. This lab was an extension of this thought, as it allowed me to think critically for the first time about the outside of a book, and how its outward presentation affects its identity and its readers. After I completed binding my book, I thought of this passage from *Baxter's Procrustes*: 

	The details of the bookmaking, however, were gone into
	thoroughly. The paper was to be of hand-made linen, from the 
	Kelmscott Mills; the type blackletter, with rubricated 
	initials. The cover, which was Baxter’s own selection, was to 
	be of dark green morocco, with a capand-bells border in red 
	inlays, and doublures of maroon morocco with a blind-tooled 
	design

Knowing how this story plays out, this excerpt is extremely ironic. But it also points to a concept this lab really drove home for me – everyone judges a book by its cover. The Bodleian Club with their naive pretense did just that. Upon seeing the expensive, luxurious cover and binding of the *Procrustes,* they decieded it was a book worth their time and thought, and assumed it was intellectually significant. 

This idea of the outside of a book determing its intellectual significance was also present in Jane Austen's letters, and discussed by Price in her book. What would Austen think of my folio? Or Lucy Soulsby, who Price quoted saying she has "no faith in reading that is compatible with an arm-chair." Would my cardstock folio bound with waxy thread in a bright yellow cover with an off-centered title and questionable wood cut make the cut for the Bodleian Club? Probably not. But I find that a bit unfair. 

The content of our books is quite fascinating. If I showed a stranger our bizarre poems, they would probably fear for Northeastern's English department. But if I explained that we effectively coded these poems, plugging in various words and phrases that with the push of a button randomly creating countless sequences, and then programmed it to be automatically tweeted each day? That is a bit more impressive. But, a stranger probably wouldn't pick this book up just by looking at it's cover, and if Jane Austen detests quartos, she would probably loathe our folios. The Bodleian Club would dismiss it as common. 
Overall, this lab allowed me to really think about the presentation of books, and how they influence my opinion before I even open the front cover.
