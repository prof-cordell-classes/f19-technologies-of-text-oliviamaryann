# Lab Report:Interactive Twine Narratives

#### Olivia Mastrosimone 

## Process Descripton 
In this lab, we took a look at Twine, an online platform used to create stories and simple games. The first step was to open Twine and take a look at a story example. Professor Cordell prepared a Twine edition of the first chapter of Moby Dick, and we went through that as a class. Before we started on our own Twines, we looked at a tutorial created by Allison Parrish to familiarize ourselves with the language and program. 

Next, Professor Cordell set us loose to create out own Twines. I had the ambitious idea to create a Twine using a short story I had written called "Look, Listen." As a sci-fi-ish story, I thought it lent iself nicelt to the medium because, for some reason, I think of text-based adventure games as being a bit spooky. I began with the first passage, or the first line of the story: "They're everywhere. And they look just like us." Very dramatic, I know. The story is based off of a strangely vivid dream I had about a town infested with these murderous *things* that looked like humans, but could only get you if you spoke to them. Anyway, I didn't get too far into the Twine process as the plot was much too ambitious for my first ever attemp, but the lab did inspire me to return to the story and start on some edits! 

## Observations 
I think the overarching theme of the labs in this class is sounds easy, but it's actually hard. I thought going into this that I'd just whip up a sci-fi alien adventure game in 35 minutes, no problem. But after literally the third passage, I was stuck. *And* I didn't really account for how the plot needed to be adjusted for Twine. It was a mess, but I definitely learned from it. 

Going off of this idea, the thing about this lab that shocked me the most was how different storytelling formats change the way a story is told, written, and laid out. Having a physical representation of my story made me recognize plot holes and timeline discrepancies. It was very interesting to see how this changes a story, and what needs to be tweaked to better work with the medium. 

## Analysis 

What I found most interested about Twine is that the stories have a digital and physical representation on the screen. You can play through the narrative like a game, but return to the graphed window and see each piece of your story and how it connects to the others. This struck me as fundamentally different to most other story telling mediums â€“ how often do storytellers give the reader a bird's eye view of the plot? 

This lab constantly brought me back to Craig Mod's Essay *Future Reading.* While there was no specific line or passage that connects explictly to Twine, the software felt in dispute with the idea of digital literature being a "black hole." Twine feels completely different than any other digital literature platorm. It didn't feel like a PDF or an ebook or a scrolling webpage or even like Bois' *17776*. Perhaps this is what Mod was hoping for. 

And with this unique medium comes unqiue storytelling challenges. Like I mentioned earlier, it is interesting to think about how writing changed to fit the medium. What prompts readers to click onto the next passage? What keeps them interested being that physical interaction is needed to advance through the story? With Twine, do regular stories have to have gaming elements to keep readers interested? I asked myself all of these questions as I was working through the lab, especially because my story idea was a failure and I wanted to understand why.
