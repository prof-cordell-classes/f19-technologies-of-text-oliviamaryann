# Lab Report: Letterpress Presswork 

#### Olivia Mastrosimone 

## Process Description 

In this lab, we worked on using the letterpress to print a poem created by our Twitter bots. The orevious lab was centered around composition, so I already had my type set on the galley, ready to be printed. First, we moved our poems from the galley to the chase. Well, I didn't *actually* move it, but rather watched Professor Cordell do so. It was a stressful maneuver to observe, as equal pressure had to be placed on all sides of the type to avoid any letters or spacers slipping out. Once the poem was in the chase, the left over space was filled with wood blocks nearing the perimeter of the chase. Between these blocks and the chase, quoins were used to fill in the empty space. Professor Cordell them tighted these quoins with a key to ensure there was enough pressure to keep the type in place. After another anxiety-inducing move, the set type was in the printing press 

Once the chase was locked into the press, we began the actual printing process. Before we printed, though, we had to ink the text. Professor Cordell kept the press "off," and one of my classmates spun a large wheel on the left of the press to get it started, and then used the foot pedal to operate the press. Large cylinders rolled over a circular ink pad and moved over the text multiple times to place the ink onto the letters.

Next, we gathered a stack of 28 sheets of paper and began printing our poetry. I was on dry rack duty for the first half, placing the freshly inked pages on a metal rack to dry. I then swapped roles with a classmates and printed 7 (and 1 extra!) pages of my Twitter bot poetry! 

## Observations

I will admit, going into our letterpress labs I was a bit skeptical as to what I would gain from the exercise. However, after the painstaking and intricate process of both setting my type and printing it, I feel what I can only describe as a kind of hyperawareness to text. I was struck with how much physical and mental energy I expended to print a 6 line poem. The entire process forced me to think a bit more criticially about what words I use and when – taking 2 hours to set 21 words will do that to you. I was also suprised with how much more aware I've become of the layout of a text - spaces, indentations, and the location of words on a page all became much more difficult than simply hitting my tab key or sliding over a text box.

My skepticism turned into frustration, which turned into appreciation. I know it sounds terribly dramatic, but was surprised by my sense of awe I felt watching the printing press. I am so used to the convience of text. Having to physically create text, and *actually* get my hands dity while doing so, allowed me to think criticially about the words I create and encounter. 

## Analysis 

Going off the idea of a hyperawareness of text, I found myself constantly thinking back to Dinius' *Look!! Look!!! at This!!!!* and the text she examines, David Walker's *Appeal*. Hitting keys on my keyboard, I don't often catch myself thinking critically about my usage of puncuation or capitalization, etc. – because I am, or at least I aspire to be, using these textual tools correctly, and therefore don't think of them as radical. However, having to physically pick up each character and create my poem letter by letter and period by period, and having to manually print my text, I had more of an appreciation for the characters I was selecting. 

For example, my poem begins with an elipses. When I read the poem on my computer screen, I didn't think much of it. However, when I had to place three periods and three spacers into the composing stick, I began to think more critically about the elipses, and what kind of messages it sends to readers. I realize now that when I firts read  *Look!! Look!!! at This!!!!* I wasn't fully grasping how meaningful each and every extra exlamation point or quotation mark was. It is hard to understand the weight of puncuation when we can hit the key on our keyboards without even looking at it. After having to create text from the ground up and being the one pressing the pedal to print it, I'll be more drawn to dissect the textual choices authors make in their work, as well as the choices I make in my own.
