#Lab Report: Into the Archives 

#### Olivia Mastrosimone 

## Process Description 

In this two-part lab, we visited the Northeastern Library Archives and Special Collections and the Massachusetts Historical Society to take a look at historical and rare prints. The purose of the lab was to become more acquainted both with the physical books and the processes we have available to view them. 

We started off by looking at historical and rare books in Northeastern's Library. This portion of the lab focused on a lot on the form of book, from folios to tunnel books. First, the librarians set up historical prints ranging in age, size, and subject matter, including a book on the history and geography of London and the famous Dragon Prayer Book. We observed the varying folios, bindings, printing techniques, and images of each piece. Then, we moved to another table of rare art books, which proved to be a much more infuriating and confusing display. Again, we took note of the form and presentation of the books, which included the especially frustrating *Boundless* by David Stairs and other books of various media. 

The second portion of the lab took place in the Massachusetts Historical Society. We took a tour of the building, stopping briefly in the various reading rooms before looking at more historical prints. On the tour, we learned a bit more about the process of accessing books at the Historical Society and what kind of books they have on and off the facility, as well as how to utilize the Society's website. Then, we looked through the books set up for us. They were mostly historical books for children, both fiction and non-fiction – but there was also a diaries and an old map of Boston before the filling in of Back Bay! This portion of the lab was focused more on the content and how authors adapted stories for young audiences and how images were incorporated into historical prints. Here are some photos of the books we looked at:

## Observations 

Something that really stuck out to me while completing this lab was the sheer amount of different forms books, both historical and modern, can take. The books I interact with on a daily basis are relatively standardized in shape and size, yet the historical prints varied greatly – from large, thick folios to tiny octavos. Not to mention the art books, of which form is intended to be played with, or rather dissassembled as a concept (did I mention how aggravating *Boundless* was?). It seems simple, but it is suprising how many different ways authors and printers can assemble and present a book. 

I was also surprised with the amount of resources available for viewing and working with these books. I never knew the Historical Society was just a quick walk down Fenway, or that I could access Northeastern's archives without an appointment or a good reason. It's odd that, as a college student studying English, these resources wouldn't be on my radar, or be encouraged by my professors or community within the humanities. This observation left me thinking about a conversation we have in class often about the exclusivity of books, and the effect different media has on what we read – I normally do my research and readings for class digitially, so why should I trek to the archives if I can find it, or something similar, online? After the lab, however, I'll definitely be more mindful of my proximity to these wonderful libraries and be more quick to consider including these books in my research. 


## Analysis 

In *How the Page Matters,* Bonnie Mak writes: 

	"The page is an expressive space for text, space, and 
	image; it is a cultural  artifact; it is a technological
	device. But it is also all of these at once."
	
I found myself constantly thinking back to this idea through both portions of the lab, specifically the idea of a book being a technological device. We looked at the two extremes of that in this lab - historical prints and manuscripts and Borsuk's *Between Page and Screen,* which literally needed a computer screen to display virtual reality text. But the older books we looked at are also technological devices, or rather a display of the cutting edge printing technology of the time. The huge folio of the history of London was a technological feat – the intricate, involved maps and fold out pages. The children's books we looked at at the Historical Society were also technological devices, using the newest tools and processes for printing images. It's interesting to think of the page as technology and a reflection of it, and this lab made it easy to track book and printing technology and understand how their definitions have changed. 

I was also struck by the idea of a page as a cultural artifact, specifically when we were looking at the rare prints and art books at NU, and the books at the Historical Society. I found myself wondering how both displays encapsulated the time period in which they were printed. For example, some of the art books *literally* depicted a specific event or moment, like the prints about the Big Dig in the early 2000s, but some captured a movement or idea of a moment in time. I think back to the book that listed out the years in which wars have been fought, or another listening out locations of violence. These both captured a moment of social activism and anti-war sentiments, without explicitly stating these intentions. 

On the other side of that, the childrens books we looked at more explicitly encapsulated the social and political climate during the time of their printing, specifically *I am an American.* This book very clearly conveyed the popular public and political opinions of the time and presented them in a way that was digestable for children. It paints a very clear picture of the time period, and exists more now as an artifact of early American culture and the ideologies the public widely subscribed to. It is also interesting to see how these ideas are still present in our present culture. Overall, this lab allowed me to think more critically about how the book interacts with the technology and culture of it's time.
