#Lab Report: Into the Archives 

#### Olivia Mastrosimone 

## Process Description 

In this two-part lab, we visited the Northeastern Library Archives and Special Collections and the Massachusetts Historical Society to take a look at historical and rare prints. The purose of the lab was to become more acquainted both with the physical books and the processes we have available to view them. 

We started off by looking at historical and rare books in Northeastern's Library. This portion of the lab focused on a lot on the form of book, from folios to tunnel books. First, the librarians set up historical prints ranging in age, size, and subject matter, including a book on the history and geography of London and the famous Dragon Prayer Book. We observed the varying folios, bindings, printing techniques, and images of each piece. Then, we moved to another table of rare art books, which proved to be a much more infuriating and confusing display. Again, we took note of the form and presentation of the books, which included the especially frustrating *Boundless* by David Stairs and other books of various media. 

The second portion of the lab took place in the Massachusetts Historical Society. We took a tour of the building, stopping briefly in the various reading rooms before looking at more historical prints. On the tour, we learned a bit more about the process of accessing books at the Historical Society and what kind of books they have on and off the facility, as well as how to utilize the Society's website. Then, we looked through the books set up for us. They were mostly historical books for children, both fiction and non-fiction â€“ but there was also a diaries and an old map of Boston before the filling in of Back Bay! This portion of the lab was focused more on the content and how authors adapted stories for young audiences and how images were incorporated into historical prints. Here are some photos of the books we looked at:
