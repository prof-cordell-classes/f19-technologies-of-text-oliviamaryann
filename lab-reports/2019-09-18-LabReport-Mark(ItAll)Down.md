# Lab Report: Mark(it all)down

Olivia Mastrosimone 

## Process Description 

Professor Cordell explained it quite well in class – this lab, and it's accompanying lab report, is very "meta," as it entailed setting up the software we will use to house our lab reports throughout the semester. We began with GitHub, which is "a hosting service for software projects," a definition that goes almost completely over my head. Basically, again using an explination by Professor Cordell, is a big folder that can be shared with team members, or classmates, and allows for changes to be made to documents without overriding the original. So, as a class we signed up for GitHub, downloaded the desktop app, and "cloned" the class folder onto our laptops. It is easier said than done, as these initial steps took about 30 minutes to complete as a class. Cloning, I learned, though unsurprisingly, is a delicate process. It required me to "locate" the class folder, a step which involved me creating a new folder on my laptop, imediately moving that folder into a another folder and receieving an error message on GitHub that the class folder was lost, which prompted Professor Cordell to provide some assistance. He explained that I needed to basically tell GitHub about the class folder's new home in my larger Technologies of Text folder, and it should all be good. Eventually, I resolved this issue, and the seemingly thousands of folders were all safe in their respective homes. 

After the class had all reached that point, we began discussing markdown and the formats of our reading responses and lab reports. This is where it gets meta, as I am writing this report in markdown (which I very quickly have come to love!). I downloaded the software MacDown, which allows for immediate rendering of markdown, and began practicing. I had some experience with markdown from another one of Professor Cordell's class, so I was not a complete beginner with it. I was playing around in a test document (see image below), 
when I stepped out of the room to use the bathroom. This is where this report gets _wildly_ meta, because when I returned to my seat and wiggled my finger over my computer's trackpad, I received no response. I learned later that day that my laptop had crashed, which is incredibly ironic condiering the nature of this lab, but was also pretty distressing. Being that I no longer had access to the medium I needed for the lab, this is where the description of the lab activity ends.

## Observations 

One of the main things I've taken away from this lab is that technology can be both friend and foe, and go from one to the other very quickly. I consider myself to be a technologically savvy individual, however, I found myself constantly frustrated while completeing the lab. Not always because I couldn't figure out a step or was falling behind, but because I didn't actually understand _what_ I was doing. Yes, I could enclose a word in underscores and make it italic, clone folders, and commit changes to the master (weird), but I was, and still am, annoyed that I don't know what is happening to make my words italic, or what is happening when I "push" documents. Obviously, there is a learning curve and considering the fact that I am the furthest from a computer scientist or coder a person can be, it makes sense that I can't comprehend concepts. This observation brought me to the larger concept of literacy, and the various ways one can interact with a text or medium, which I will come back to in my analysis. 

Looking past this frustration, and before I lost my computer, 


This class's first lab may very well be the most difficult to write about – not becuase the lab was overly complicated or demanding, but because by writing this lab report I am effectively still participating in the lab, more than a week after it's "completion."
