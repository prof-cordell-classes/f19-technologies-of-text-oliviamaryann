# Lab Report: Zine You Around 

#### Olivia Mastrosimone

## Process Description 
In this lab, we explored the world of zine making. We entered the room to find old copies of *The New Yorker* and travel magazines strewn about the table, a pair of scissors and a glue stick in front of every chair. First, we were given a piece of regular copy paper. We folded this into an 8-page zine, making a small cut with our saftey scissors and doing some fancy twist that ended with the creation of a small octavo!

Then, we began the zine-ing, given free reign to create any kind of book we liked. I didn't know exactly where I wanted to go with it, so I started by flipping through the magazines and cutting out anyting I found interesting. Of course, I picked probably the most diffcult things to cut with our tiny scissors. I ended up having a lot of hands and faces, nature scenes, and little phrases. The first thing I glued down was the front cover, which was a picture of people kayaking in a body of water surrounded by mountains, with hands coming up around the boat from above and below. I added text that read "Uncontaminated Togetherness," which I then deceided would be the theme of my zine. I didn't get to finish the entire book, But I did create two pages I really liked, and one I wasn't too jazzed about.
