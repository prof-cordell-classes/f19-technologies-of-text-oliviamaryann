# Lab Report: Zine You Around 

#### Olivia Mastrosimone

## Process Description 
In this lab, we explored the world of zine making. We entered the room to find old copies of *The New Yorker* and travel magazines strewn about the table, a pair of scissors and a glue stick in front of every chair. First, we were given a piece of regular copy paper. We folded this into an 8-page zine, making a small cut with our saftey scissors and doing some fancy twist that ended with the creation of a small octavo!

Then, we began the zine-ing, given free reign to create any kind of book we liked. I didn't know exactly where I wanted to go with it, so I started by flipping through the magazines and cutting out anyting I found interesting. Of course, I picked probably the most diffcult things to cut with our tiny scissors. I ended up having a lot of hands and faces, nature scenes, and little phrases. The first thing I glued down was the front cover, which was a picture of people kayaking in a body of water surrounded by mountains, with hands coming up around the boat from above and below. I added text that read "Uncontaminated Togetherness," which I then deceided would be the theme of my zine. I didn't get to finish the entire book, But I did create two pages I really liked, and one I wasn't too jazzed about.

## Observations
I didn't know when coming into the lab whether I should expect to be relaxed or pulling out my hair. I've never been one to have the attention span to sit down and do arts and crafts, not to diminish zine making – even as a child, I found it stressful. I am at once both a perfectionist and pretty lazy, so cutting out small, detailed pieces from magazines and understanding lay out and design is just at times too much for me. I guess I felt both ease and anziety while making my zine, but I was definitely invested and focused, which was surprising. I found myself lost in the process, whether that was in catharsis or a creative frenzy. I was in the end proud of what I made and how much I had completed! 

I think what I found most interesting was observing the creative process of my classmates. I don't think of myself as a creative person and I struggle to think through and complete creative projects, so hearing how people thought through the concept and design of their zines was really illuminating. 

## Analysis
With that idea in mind, I found myself thinking back to this quote from Erin Dorney's erasure poem style guide: 
		
	There are so many variables: your source text, 
	your mood, whether you’re working by hand or 
	on computer, the marker or pencil you pick up, 
	how quickly your eye scans across the page. 

I thought this concept was very interesting while I was reading. This explicit subjectivity is not something I register with more traditional forms of writing and I didn't quite understand why until this lab. There is something to be said about pieces of literature or art whose content relies on a source text, like erasure poetry and zines. Yes, all writing is subjective. If you tell 100 people to write poems about a tree you'll get 100 different ones, but the subjectivity feels more urgent when there's something to be working *off of*. In class, we all had access to the same magazines, yet we all made completely different zines. It seems obvious, but it's an interesting concept to analyze. 

Creating zines, similarly to Dooney's claim about erasure poetry, is to rely on variables – both physical and emotional.  Had I sat in front of a different magazine first, or been given a different pair of scissors, or been in a different mood that day, my zine would have been completely different. I don't find my writing process to be this suseptical to outside forces when I'm writing an academic essay or even a lab report for this class. I enjoyed making the zine so much because I realized I don't ever write or produce creatively. I found the process similar to writing music, which is something I used to do frequently but have since become too busy (but really too lazy) to do. Overall, this lab made me question the ways we write and create.
