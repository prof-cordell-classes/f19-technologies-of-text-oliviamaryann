# Lab Report: Illuminating the Text 

#### Olivia Mastrosimone

## Process Description 

In this lab, we worked to interact with text as scribes did – by candlelight. We entered the classroom to find lit candles placed along the large table, with a book, two sheets of paper, and a pencil placed on either side of them. One of these sheets was blank, and the other was a copy of a handwritten letter. Our task was to trancscribe as much as we could of the letter as accurately as we could in 25 minutes. I received an extremely sloppy letter, which I later learned was written by Virginia Woolf. It was extremely difficult and at times nearly impossible to read her handwriting, so my transcription was littered with blank spaces and question marks in spots when the writing was illegible. At the end of the exercise, my page was not even a quarter of the way full, while the classmate to my left, who was lucky enough to get a letter written by Edgar Allan Poe, had fully transribed her letter. 

After we finished transcribing, we were instructed to look at the book placed in front of us with a partner and figure out what it was used for. My partner and I concluded it was a geography textbook from the 1800s, including intricate maps and images of the information it was teaching students about. We then swapped books with another pair, only to find the same textbook without maps or images of any kind – strange for a geography textbook. 

After we finished looking at our textbooks, we discussed the similarities and differences in each pair's copy. Professor Cordell explained that the discrepancies may be attributed to the publisher, as book piracy was running rampant during this books popularity and publishers would effectively print knock offs to yield a higher profit. 

## Observations 

The most shocking thing I observed about this lab was the physical and mental toll it took on me. I avoid hand writing anything at all costs – I have horrible handwriting and hold my hand and position my body in such a way that I get very sore *very* fast. Basically, this lab was my nightmare. After about 5 minutes, my handwriting was getting worse and my hand was cramping. My shoulders hurt. My neck hurt. My eyes hurt. I was getting pretty visibly frustrated, not only by my discomfort but by my inability to even read the words I was transcribing. To be honest, I genuinely did not enjoy this exercise. But I guess that was the point of the exercise. 

The issue of Woolf's handwriting was also suprising to me. I never thought about the texts scribes were working off of, only the text they eventually produced. What would scribes do if they couldn't read their original document? Were they trained to decipher difficult handwriting? Was this even an issue, or was anyone who was lucky enough to know how to write know how to do it neatly? These questions are particularly interesting to me because I have effectively illegible handwriting and often struggle to read my own, but am able to work out the scribbles because I'm used to reading it. Trying to red someone else's chicken scratch, though, is a whole other story. 

These questions followed into the segment about the geography textbook and how many substandard copies were floating around during the height of the book's usage. I found this to be a bit funny. I felt pity for the students who purchased the book only to find no images or maps, or with chapters ommited. It's interesting to reflect upon our modern idea of book standardization, and just how modern this concept actually is. 

## Analysis 

The main thing this lab left me thinking about is how personalized codices were throughout the periods of transcription and printing. I tend to think of the actual text in books as the pinnacle of standardization, not reflecting the personality of the publisher or printer or author. Not at the mercy of a sloppy scribe or greedy compositor. But after this lab, I realize this concept of relying on the regularity of text is not only a very recent development, but a luxurious one. 

Going off of this, because text was at the whim of whoever was creating it, codecies and other works have the ability to show the passing of time. Yes, editions of textbooks are updated and altered, the covers of books are rediesgned with a reprint, but modern codecies dont have the ability to show age, or a decline or improvement in printing skill, or a change in environment like transcribed or printed pieces do. 

Borsuk includes this excerpt from a book by Ulises Carrión: 

	Each of these spaces is perceived at a different 
	moment – a book is also a sequence of moments
	
					        ••••	
					       
   	A book is not a case of words, nor a bag of words, 
   	nor a bearer of words. 
   	
   						    ••••
   						    
    ... A book is a space time sequence 
    
Using this quote, it's interesting to think about transcibed texts, printed texts, and engraved texts like Blake's as "space time sequences." If I was a scribe before the advent of the printing press, perhaps my texts would show an improvement in handwriting over time. The same can be said for me being a compositor or printer. The various different colorways and designs in the editons of Blake's *The Marriage of Heaven and Hell* that we looked at demomnstrate the passing of time, and perhaps a change in personal taste, an improvement in skill or access to resources. All of these are things we lose with modern, computerized printing of books. The physical book has become largely removed from the creators, and therefore has lost most of its status as a piece of art. 

However, the standardization and mass production of text is not only a negative thing. Obviously, being able to rely on a text's physicality and content is beneficial in most cases, and there are still ways to reflect artistry in a 21st century codes. However, it is interesting to think about this issue and how it may effect how we define codecies.
