# Lab Report: Programming Literature 

#### Olivia Mastrosimone 

## Process Description 

The Programming Literature lab is yet another activity I am having trouble describing because I can't comprehend the more technical aspects, similarly to the previous lab involving GitHub and MarkDown. Therefor, my attempt at describing exactly what I did may be, at times, rudimentary. We began the lab activity with a brief overview of Twitter bots, looking through a few of Professor Cordell's favorites. Having come to class that day with my Twitter account and poem already prepared, we then jumped into actually constructing the bot. This is where is gets difficult, and where my synopsis becomes, well, difficult. 

We first opened Tracery, the program we used to code our bots. As a class, we looked at the pre-made JSON files Tracery had provided and played around with the generated text. Something I noticed that is effectively useless to this process description is Tracery's inclusion of a Nightvale category for text generation, and I have to say, it is spot on. It seemed very complicated, though, so my appreciation of it was very surface level. Either way, I did spend a few minutes generating erie Nightvale-esque text. 

Back to the actual lab. Professor Cordell demonstrated simple JSON "series of attribute-value pairs" (I hope I am using this term correctly!) and how to plug them in to the Tracery editor. I fumbled around a bit with the premade "landscape" text, as well as one provided by Professor Cordell, and then decieded, overconfidently, to jump right into drafting my own JSON file with an exerpt of a Frank O'Hara poem I had chosen. The stanza is from O'Hara's poem "Ode to Michael Goldberg ('s Birth and other Births)," and is as follows: 

    … there
    the wind sounded exactly like
    Stravinsky
     	I first recognized art
 	 as wildness and it seemed right
 	 	I mean rite, to me
 	 	
I was drawn to this stanza for a lot of reasons. I loved the formatting of it, and the cheekiness. Also, I immediately saw a few words that could be replaced with "attribute value pairs." I decieded that the words "wind," "Stravinsky," "recognized," and "wildness" would be replaced with a generated word. I opened up Text Edit and started drafting the JSON file. I entered in a couple of weather events for "wind," weird musical genres (like Cowpunk and Ambient techno... can't explain this, I just thought it was fun), negative verbs for "recgnized" and mainly negative adjectives for "wildness." Here's a photo of of JSON file.

I then copied and pasted the text into the Tracery editor and, _not_ to my suprise, nothing happened. In hindsight, I should've worked in smaller sections, but I was convinced that I would be able to do this on my first try. I was wrong. I had to then painstakingly go through each pair and correct any errors, and change each quotation mark to the plain text version (this drove me crazy). By then our class time was almost through, but I was commited to getting this Bot up and running. Eventually, I corrected all of the errors and it worked (woo hoo!) I then followed the "Cheap Bots, Done Quick" link on our class website, connected it to my Bot's twitter account, and set it up to post once every day. Here's my bot's first tweet!

## Observations 

It is safe to say that I found this lab extremely frustrating. I am about as far away from a coder or computer scientist as a person can get, but I imagine that anything to do with any kind of code is also extremely frustrating by nature of its tedium. However, this lab gave me a greater appreciation of those who know anything about computer code, and code itself. It may not seem like it, but coding is fairly physical. In just the short time I was "coding," my eyes were strained, my neck was hurting from hunching over, and I was about ready to pull my hair out. I had never thought to connect coding to anything remotely physical, and this lab allowed me to come to that conlcusion first hand. 

Despite my frustration, I did find this lab to be extremely rewarding. The pure and utter defeat I felt after plugging my JSON file into Tracery and having nothing come out was overshadowed by the pride I felt after my first tweet was posted. It sounds silly, but I walked out of the class feeling very accomplished – perhaps because I found the lab so physical. 

This lab also raised a lot of questions for me, but they were all very vague. Basically I just wanted to know exactly _what_ I was doing – when I had to type the little squiggly brakets, the colons, the quotation marks. Essentially, I now have a lot of questions about what code even is, and how it causes anything to happen. It sounds a bit childish, I know, but I am coming from a place of extreme ignorance on the subject. I am glad that I have these questions, though, and have already begun diving into Wikipedia articles and other resources to learn more about code! 

## Analysis 

The main thing our Coding Literature lab left me pondering is the ways in which we can communicate without physically speaking or writing (depening on your definition of code – is it its own language? An extension of langauge? This is a conversation for another, more technologically versed day). There were a few ways I felt this happening during the lab: 

1. Writing the code, and doing so using a piece of text already written. 


2. Setting my bot to tweet once every day, without me having to type or press "tweet." 


The first example on the list of this vacant communication brought me back to Ælfric's preface to his translation of *Genesis*. It might be a stretch, but in using a piece of poetry already crafted by someone much more qualified and, well, poetic than me, I felt guilty, like I had dissapointed by friend Ælfric. I was doing everything the scribe was afraid of: I am an unqualified "lesser scribe," taking a work, keeping its form but completely altering the meaning. What if whoever happens to stumble upon my bot now equates wind to cool jazz, and goes around attacking art as evasive or apathetic, and it throughs society as we know it into chaos, like Ælfric predicts? 

In all seriousness, this activity opened my eyes to the ways in which we recycle text and, often, completely remove it from its original meaning. In the same way our language, phrases and idioms evolve, so do our texts. Perhaps Ælfric would be thrown into a tizzy if he knew how we were interpreting his preface. 

The second example on the list reminds me of Butler's *Speech Sounds*, because I was communicating non-verbally and, er, non-writtenly. I am able to have a piece of text sent to what could possibly be millions of people all over the world and I quite iterally do not know when or how this message is sent, or to whom exactly it is sent to. I am completely removed from my own communication. I did not have to read or write or speak, yet I communicated with those around me. It is an interesting thing to think about in regards to *Speech Sounds*, although I'm not sure how much use a Twitter bot would be in a post-apocolyptic world. Who knows, maybe Rye would get a kick out of my O'Hara bot. 

This connection is perhaps less strong, but I kept thinking how useful social media, Twitter especially, may have been to the inhabitants of Butler's world, specifically for those who can read but not speak.
