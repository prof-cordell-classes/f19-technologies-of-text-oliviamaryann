# Lab Report: Programming Literature 

#### Olivia Mastrosimone 

## Process Description 

The Programming Literature lab is yet another activity I am having trouble describing because I can't comprehend the more technical aspects, similarly to the previous lab involving GitHub and MarkDown. Therefor, my attempt at describing exactly what I did may be, at times, rudimentary. We began the lab activity with a brief overview of Twitter bots, looking through a few of Professor Cordell's favorites. Having come to class that day with my Twitter account and poem already prepared, we then jumped into actually constructing the bot. This is where is gets difficult, and where my synopsis becomes, well, difficult. 

We first opened Tracery, the program we used to code our bots. As a class, we looked at the pre-made JSON files Tracery had provided and played around with the generated text. Something I noticed that is effectively useless to this process description is Tracery's inclusion of a Nightvale category for text generation, and I have to say, it is spot on. It seemed very complicated, though, so my appreciation of it was very surface level. Either way, I did spend a few minutes generating erie Nightvale-esque text. 

Back to the actual lab. Professor Cordell demonstrated simple JSON "series of attribute-value pairs" (I hope I am using this term correctly!) and how to plug them in to the Tracery editor. I fumbled around a bit with the premade "landscape" text, as well as one provided by Professor Cordell, and then decieded, overconfidently, to jump right into drafting my own JSON file with an exerpt of a Frank O'Hara poem I had chosen. The stanza is from O'Hara's poem "Ode to Michael Goldberg ('s Birth and other Births)," and is as follows: 

    â€¦ there
    the wind sounded exactly like
    Stravinsky
     	I first recognized art
 	 as wildness and it seemed right
 	 	I mean rite, to me
 	 	
I was drawn to this stanza for a lot of reasons. I loved the formatting of it, and the cheekiness. Also, I immediately saw a few words that could be replaced with "attribute value pairs." I decieded that the words "wind," "Stravinsky," "recognized," and "wildness" would be replaced with a generated word. I opened up Text Edit and started drafting the JSON file. I entered in a couple of weather events for "wind," weird musical genres (like Cowpunk and Ambient techno... can't explain this, I just thought it was fun), negative verbs for "recgnized" and mainly negative adjectives for "wildness." Here's a photo of of JSON file.

I then copied and pasted the text into the Tracery editor and, _not_ to my suprise, nothing happened. In hindsight, I should've worked in smaller sections, but I was convinced that I would be able to do this on my first try. I was wrong. I had to then painstakingly go through each pair and correct any errors, and change each quotation mark to the plain text version (this drove me crazy). By then our class time was almost through, but I was commited to getting this Bot up and running. Eventually, I corrected all of the errors and it worked (woo hoo!) I then followed the "Cheap Bots, Done Quick" link on our class website, connected it to my Bot's twitter account, and set it up to post once every day. Here's my bot's first tweet!
