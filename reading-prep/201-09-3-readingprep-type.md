# Reading Prep:Type

## Questions and Observations 

1. In the excerpts from _In Praise of Scribes_, Trithemius writes "The printed book is a thing of paper and in a short time will decay entirely. But the scribe commending letters to parchment extends his own and the letters' lifespan for ages." Do you agree with his claim that the *act* of writing is as immortal as the writing itself? 
2. Chris Gayomali's article _How Typeface Influences the Way We Read and Think_, addressed the way font affects not only how we read text, but how we think about and measure the significance of the words. Does this reinforce Trithemius' idea of a book transcibed by a scribe being more "sacred" than those printed on paper? 
3. Sarah Werner's article _Finding women in the printing shop_ brought up interesting ideas about how a book's history can impact its content. Do you think that knowing the full history of a text is an important factor when reading, or separate from the text?
