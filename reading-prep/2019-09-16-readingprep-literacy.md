##Questions and Observations 

1. How does Issac Assimov's introduction to Butler's _Speech Sounds_ speak to Ælfric's Introduction to Genesis? Ælfric is concerned with the possibility of mintranslations and misinterpretations – does this not confirm Asimov's theory about science fiction being purely an exploration of _possible_ situations? 
2. How did you feel about the layout and design of Borsuk's _The Book_? Personally, I found the images and full, colored page quotes distracting and disruptive to my flow of reading. How can we reconcile with the fact that books can inform but also distract us from information? 
3. On page 42 of _The Book_, there is a quote from D.F. McKenzie that reads: "A book is never simple a remarkable _object_. Like every other technology, it is invariably the product of human agency in complex and highly volatile contexts." Using this theory as reference, would you define the method of communcation the characters in _Speech Sounds_ used as a book? As text?
