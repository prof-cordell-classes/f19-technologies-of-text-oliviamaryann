# Reading Prep: Format

#### Olivia Mastrosimone 

##Questions and Observations 

1. In Baxter's Procrustes,* whose pretense was more egregious, Baxter’s or the committee’s? Whose more founded? 
2. In Price's chapter "Interleaf: Please Lay Flat," she includes this quote from Lucy Soulsby: "I have no faith in reading that is compatible with an arm-chair." Price is disputing this idea throughout the chapter, yet it is set in a way that makes it's content extremely difficult to read. What do you make of this statement? 
3. Reading Price's chapters and the Jane Austen letters, there seems to have been an intellectual hierarchy of different sized folios. Do you agree? Is this concept contrived? Do you see examples of this today?
