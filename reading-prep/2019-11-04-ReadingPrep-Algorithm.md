##Questions and Observations

2. I read this book on the kindle app on my laptop and it was extremely hard to read. Should graphic novels be adpated to fit digital platforms? 
3. The book was extremely technical despite it's form. Do you think technical information should be conveyed in this way, or was the graphicap aspect distracting?
