## Questions and Observsations 

1. After reading *Look!! Look!!! at This!!!!*, it seems like the Western grammatical tools for expressing emotion through text have to be broken to express emotion with any accuracy or authenticity. Do you agree? 

2. David Walker's *Appeal* is a piece that begs to be read aloud. Do you think all text is meant to be spoken? By whom, and to whom?  

3. Compare *Women Compositors* and *Look!! Look!!! at This!!!!*. While writen in very different circumstances, both are protest texts. What do you make of the differences in the formality of the typography? What does this say about the texts function, place, audience, etc?
