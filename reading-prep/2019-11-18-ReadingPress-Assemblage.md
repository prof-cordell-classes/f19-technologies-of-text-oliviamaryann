# Reading Prep: Assemblage
#### Olivia Mastrosimone 

## Questions and Observations: 
1. On a few occasions, Pagan Kennedy referenced the idea of "publishing respectably." What does respectably mean here? 
2. There were a few things from Pagan's zine gave me pause â€“ something that 2019 readers now know to be innapropriate or offensive. There's always risk publishing your thoughts on something. How are zines similar to social media in this way? 
3. Erin Dorney explains that erasure poetry is dependant on variables like mood, technology, etc. This was interesting. Do you think all writing is dependant on variables like this?
