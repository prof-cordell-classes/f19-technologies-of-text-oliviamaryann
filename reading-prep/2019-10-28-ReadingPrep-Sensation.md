# Reading Prep: Sensation

## Questions and Observations 

1. I was fascinated by Octave Uzanne's depiction of the future of books being one that is so socially accessible. In addition to the public photographotecks and travelling authors, he envisioned language and tone being simplified and streamlined:
"Little by little, the taste for style and for pompously decorated phrases will die away, but the art of utterance will take on unheard-of importance." This removes an intellectual barrier written word constructs. Why should spoken words be simpler? Why is it understood that written word can be superfluous or decorated in a way that doesnt resemble every day speech? 
2. Reading *All Technology Is Assistive: Six Design Rules on Disability,* I was shocked to learn how much overlap there is between visual art and assistive technology. What do you make of their similarites? 
3. Reading *The Universal Page,* the Optophpone and the idea of language having pitch really fascinated me. I know there are languages that rely on pitch already, but each individual letter having a unique sound was for some reason hard to comprehend. After thinking about this for a few minutes, I realized the Ontophone's usage of Western musical pitches isn't much different than each letter having it's own distinct pronounciation, but it *feels* different. Also, I wonder if the Ontophone was widely used, would it alter language? Would some word or letter parings sound better or worse than others and cause them to be more or less common?
